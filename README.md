# Subtree merge

> Merge multiple repos to one with histories using subtrees

## Install

```sh
yarn global add https://github.com/rajatsharma/subtree-merge
```

## Usage

```sh
subtree-merge repo1 repo2 repo3@branch
```

Right now it only supports my remotes ie `github.com/rajatsharma/{repo_name}`.
